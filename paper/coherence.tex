\subsection{Coherence cells between coherence cells}
Finally we add all coherence cells between parallel coherence
cells and their compositions. To this end we define a predicate
$\hollow$ on objects:
\[
\AxiomC{$x :  \Obj~C$}
\UnaryInfC{$\hollow~x~:~\Set$}
\DisplayProof
\]
%
Such that all identities, $\alpha$'s, $\rho$'s, $\lambda$'s and
$\chi$'s are hollow, and all weakenings and compositions of
hollow cells are hollow. Then we introduce a constructor of $\Obj$:
\[
\AxiomC{$f ~ g : \Obj~\homcat{C}{a}{b}$}
\AxiomC{$p : \hollow~f$}
\AxiomC{$q : \hollow~g$}
\TrinaryInfC{$\mathsf{coh}~f~g~p~q :
  \Obj~\homcat{\homcat{C}{a}{b}}{f}{g}$}
\DisplayProof
\]
%
And we define $\hollow~(\mathsf{coh}~f~g~p~q) = \top$.
