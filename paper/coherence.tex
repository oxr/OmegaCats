\label{sec:coherence}

\subsection{The need of more coherence}
In the previous sections we showed how to define all coherence cells
witnessing the axioms of a strict $\omega$-category. Namely, left and
right units of composition, associativity of composition, and the
interchange property. These can be composed to witnesses identity of
cells which don't exactly match the sides of either of the axioms. 

For instance, to witness the equality
\[(g \,\id_{b})\,f \quad = \quad g\, f\]
we can compose $\lambda$ after $\alpha$ to obtain a witnesses such as: 
\[\id_{g}\lambda_f \cdot \alpha_{g,\id_g,f}  ~:~ (g
\,\id_{b})\,f \longrightarrow   g\, f\qquad\text{   and    }\qquad
 \rho \, \id_f ~ : ~ (g\,\id_{b})\,f \longrightarrow   g\, f\quad.\]

In the strict case
equality of 1-cells is a proposition and therefore all proofs of
equality of 1-cells are equal. In the weak 2-categorical case, 
equality of 1-cells is not propositional -- it is witnessed by
2-cells. In other words, only the first level is weakened.
As equality of 2-cells is a proposition, one must add 
further axioms about the introduced coherence 2-cells. 
For instance:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lambda-alpha}
\bfig
\qtriangle<750,500>[(g\,\id_{b}) \,f ` g\,(\id_{b}\,f)`g\, f;
\alpha_{g,\id_g,f}`\rho\,\id_f`\id_g\,\lambda_f]
\efig
\end{equation}
% 
In our case, when all levels are weakened the equality
is replaced be a new 3-cell 
\[\id_{g}\lambda_f \cdot \alpha_{g,\id_g,f}
\longrightarrow \rho\,\id_f\]
%
Moreover, for any pair of such 3-cells, $p,\,q : \id_{g}\lambda_f \cdot \alpha_{g,\id_g,f}\longrightarrow
\rho\,\id_f$, there must be 4-cell $p \longrightarrow q$,  etc., all
the way up to $\omega$. This is a weakening of propositionality of
equality of $n$-cells in the strict setting. The following diagram
illustrates this up to level 4:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lambda-alpha}
\bfig\scalefactor{1.5}
\qtriangle<750,500>[(g\,\id_{b}) \,f ` g\,(\id_{b}\,f)`g\, f;
\alpha_{g,\id_g,f}`\rho\,\id_f`\id_g\,\lambda_f]
\morphism(650,450)/{@{>}@/_1em/}/<-200,-200>[`;p]
\morphism(700,400)|b|/{@{>}@/^1em/}/<-200,-200>[`;q]
\morphism(480,400)|b|/..>/<170,-135>[`;]
\efig
\end{equation}
%
In summary and full generality: 
\begin{quote}
  \emph{For any pair of coherence cells with the same domain and
    codomain, there must be a mediating coherence cell.}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Formalising coherence cells between coherence cells}

%
We formalise the above principle as follows. We define a predicate 
$\hollow$ on objects
% \[
% \AxiomC{$x :  \Obj~C$}
% \UnaryInfC{$\hollow~x~:~\Set$}
% \DisplayProof
% \]
% %
such that $\hollow\,(\id\,f)= \top$ where $\top$ is the one element Set. 
Moreover each coherence cell is hollow
\[
\begin{array}{c}
\hollow\,(\lambda\,\_\,\_) = \top \quad \hollow(\rho\,\_\,\_)
  ~=~\top\quad \hollow\,(\alpha,\_\,\_\,\_) = \top
  \quad\hollow~(\chi\,\_\,\_\,\_\,\_) = \top\\
\hollow\,(\iota~f) = \top \quad \hollow\,(\kappa~f) = \top
\end{array}
\]
Further we close $\hollow$ under weakening, composition and inverses. 
Finally, we introduce a constructor of $\Obj$ and a clause of $\hollow$:
\[
\AxiomC{$f ~ g : \Obj~\homcat{C}{a}{b}$}
\AxiomC{$p : \hollow~f$}
\AxiomC{$q : \hollow~g$}
\TrinaryInfC{$\mathsf{coh}~p~q :
  \Obj~\homcat{\homcat{C}{a}{b}}{f}{g}$}
\DisplayProof
\qquad
\AxiomC{$\hollow\,(\coh\,p\,q) = \top$}
\DisplayProof 
\]
The last remaining case are variables, which are not hollow:
\[
\AxiomC{$\hollow\,(\var\, v) = \bot$}
\DisplayProof 
\]
