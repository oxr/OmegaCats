\section{Conclusions and Further Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\subsection{Summary}
We have presented a novel approach to defining weak $\omega$-groupoids
which is based on ideas from Type Theory. The central idea is to
define the syntax of weak $\omega$-groupoids and then define a weak
$\omega$-groupoid as a globular set with an interpretation of the
syntax, which is where Type Theory has its greatest strength. Our
approach to formalization of coherence is natural, in a way naive,
since it is a natural generalisation of the corresponding first order
laws.

We have formalized all of the material presented here in Agda
\cite{agda}, except for the definition of the telescope morphism for
$\chi$, which wasn't ready in time for submission. We believe this is
a technicality, albeit a difficult one. The Agda source file is available
from \cite{coreagda}.


\subsection{Related work}
There exists an abundance of categorical definitions of weak
$\omega$-categories and groupoids.  Although a direct comparison is a
slippery road, we would like to give a rough comparison of the key
similarities and differences between our and other definitions. Most
importantly, our definition is fundamentally different in that it is
formulated in Type Theory rather than Category Theory. This means that
we couldn't just formalise any of the approaches
\cite{penon:1999,batanin98:monoidal-globular,leinster:2000} because
the notion a strict $\omega$-category is central in them in that it
drives the definition of coherence cells. However, it is unclear to how define
\emph{strict} $\omega$-categories in Type Theory
without quotient types. This forces some of the choices we have
made. Nevertheless, on an intuitive level there are similarities of our approach to the
categorical approaches, some of which we mention below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Penon's definition \cite{penon:1999}, similarly to us, uses
  binary rather than unbiased composition, and explicit
  identities. 
\item As we can't form quotients and compare for strict equality in
  the underlying strict monoidal set, we, similarly to Street
  \cite{street87:simplexes}, try to understand the recursion pattern
  behind coherence cells.
\item Batanin's \emph{spans} are essentially our telescopes. However
  his composition is unbiased and therefore he considers trees in
  spans, which are definable but of no importance to us.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Further work}
The current formalisation is still
quite complicated and we hope to find ways to simplify it. One interesting
idea may be to use the syntactical approach to define opetopes based on
dependent polynomial functors (i.e. indexed containers) \cite{opetopes},
which has a very type-theoretic flavour.  

We would like to use our framework to provide a formalisation of a
variation of the results in
\cite{lumsdaine10:weak-o-categories,berg08:types-are} by showing that
$\Idw$ is a weak $\omega$-groupoid. Such a formalisation would be different form
their results because we are working inside Type Theory, rather than on
a meta-level.

The main challenge ahead is to formalize the notion of a
$\omega$-groupoid model of Type Theory. Once this has been done we
will be able to eliminate the univalence axiom and provide a
computational interpretation of this principle.
