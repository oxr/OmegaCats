\section{Conclusions and Further Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have presented a novel approach to defining weak $\omega$-groupoids
which is based on ideas from Type Theory. A central idea is to define
the syntax of weak $\omega$-groupoids which is where Type Theory has
its greatest strength. Indeed, we have formalized most of the material
presented here in Agda \cite{agda}.  We believe that our approach is
quite natural, in a way naive, since our approach to formalizing coherence
cells seems a natural generalisation of the corresponding first
order laws.

The current formalisation is still
quite big and we hope to find ways to simplify it. One interesting
idea may be to use the recent approach to define opetopes based on
dependent polynomial functors (i.e. indexed containers) \cite{opetopes},
which has a very type-theoretic flavour.  

We would like to use our framework to provide a formalisation of a
variation of the results by in
\cite{lumsdaine10:weak-o-categories,berg08:types-are} by showing that
$\Idw$ is a weak $\omega$-groupoid. This is slightly different form
their results because we are working insinde Type Theory instead of on
a metalevel.

The main challenge ahead is to formalize the notion of an
$\omega$-groupoid model of Type Theory. Once this has been done we
will be able to eliminate the univalence axiom and provide a
computational interpretation of this principle.
