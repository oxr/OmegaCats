1. Finish Dummy
-- define contractible T-operad (straightforward)
-- define algebras for an operad
-- hence weak-1 cat is an algebra for a contractible T-operads
-- (brutal top hence no assoc, could be fixed by changing defn of contraction)

2. From Dummy to Glob
-- replace graphs by globular sets (coinductive)
-- hence arrive at a notion of weak omega cat

3. Find omega cats
-- normal cat should be an omega cat (dummy)
-- bicat is a weak omega cat
-- show that Idw is a weak omega cat
